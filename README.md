# vimconfig
Configuration for vim.

Vim uses the vimrc file for initializations.

The file can be (depending on the OS) in the following locations (see `:h initialization`):
* $HOME/.vimrc
* $HOME/.vim/vimrc
* $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc
* $HOME/\_vimrc
* $VIM/.vimrc (or \_vimrc)
* $VIM/\_vimrc
* s:.vimrc
* home:.vimrc
* home:vimfiles:vimrc

With the option -u vim can be forced to use a specific file for initializations.

```sh
vim -u {vimrc}
```
